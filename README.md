# Adventure_Game
I designed and coded this adventure game for my AP Computer Science A final project. In this game, the player can type input to play out
various commands. The name of my game is "Ghost Buster," and I took inspiration from the Ghost Busters movie as well as Luigi's Mansion. In this game,
the player must find the correct ghost-busting items in a haunted mansion to defeat the ghost!
